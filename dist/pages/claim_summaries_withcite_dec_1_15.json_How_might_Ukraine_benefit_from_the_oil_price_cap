# How might Ukraine benefit from the oil price cap?

## Summary
Ukraine stands to benefit from the price cap on Russian oil as it reduces the Kremlin's revenue and prevents a spike in global oil prices. The price cap of $60 per barrel, which is enforced by companies providing shipping, insurance and other services for Russian oil, was agreed upon by the European Union, the Group of Seven nations, Australia, and the U.S. <font color=#FF3399>[1,3,4,5]</font>. This measure is intended to limit Russia's ability to fund its war in Ukraine and is designed to maintain adequate supplies of crude on the global energy market <font color=#FF3399>[2]</font>. By reducing Russia's income from oil exports the price cap ensures that Ukraine's economy can remain stable and that global oil prices do not experience a dramatic increase <font color=#FF3399>[3,5]</font>.
