# How will the Finnish government's decision to restrict Russian citizens' entry into the country impact relations between Finland and Russia?

## Summary
The Finnish government has recently announced plans to significantly restrict the right of Russian citizens to enter the country as tourists or in transit when traveling to other parts of the Schengen area <font color=#FF3399>[1]</font>. This move follows an exodus of citizens fleeing Russia, and other Western countries shutting both physical frontiers and their air space to Russian planes <font color=#FF3399>[2]</font>. As a result, Finland has become one of the few entry points into Europe for Russians <font color=#FF3399>[3]</font>. The government is now assessing risks posed by individuals travelling through Finland, and is considering ways to sharply reduce Russian transit <font color=#FF3399>[4]</font>. To that end, Finland has imposed restrictions on the entry of Russian citizens travelling solely for the purpose of tourism or leisure <font color=#FF3399>[5]</font>. This includes limiting the number of visa applications per day to only 100, and receiving applications only on Monday in four cities <font color=#FF3399>[5]</font>. As such, it is likely that this decision to restrict Russian citizens' entry will have a negative effect on the relationship between Finland and Russia.
