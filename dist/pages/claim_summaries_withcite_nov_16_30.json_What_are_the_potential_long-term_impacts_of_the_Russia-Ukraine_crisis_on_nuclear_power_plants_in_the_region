# What are the potential long-term impacts of the Russia-Ukraine crisis on nuclear power plants in the region?

## Summary
The Russia-Ukraine crisis has put a strain on nuclear power plants located in the region, with the potential for long-term impacts. On November 15th, 2020, the Khmelnitsky nuclear power plant lost its grid connection after four operating power lines were taken out of operation by missile strikes <font color=#FF3399>[2]</font>. This was a concerning development, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi, who warned of the potential nuclear safety and security risks <font color=#FF3399>[3]</font>. On Wednesday, the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant lost access to external electricity again, and is now relying on emergency diesel generators <font color=#FF3399>[4]</font>. Negotiations with Kyiv and Moscow on the establishment of a safety zone around the plant are ongoing, but the IAEA Director General is warning of potential consequences and that "we cannot continue counting on good luck to avoid a nuclear accident" <font color=#FF3399>[5]</font>.

It shows the potential nuclear safety and security risks facing all of Ukraines nuclear facilities during this terrible war, not just the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. While off-site power is now back at the Khmelnitsky nuclear power plant, yesterdays power loss clearly demonstrates that the nuclear safety and security situation in Ukraine can suddenly take a turn for the worse, increasing the risk of a nuclear emergency." Khmelnitsky lost its grid connection at 18:35 local time on 15 November after its four operating power lines were taken out of operation by missile strikes over a two and a half hour period, according to reports submitted by Ukrainian authorities to the IAEA.|
