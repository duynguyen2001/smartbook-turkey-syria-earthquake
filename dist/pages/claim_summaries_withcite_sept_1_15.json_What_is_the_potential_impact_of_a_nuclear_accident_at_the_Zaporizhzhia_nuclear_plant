# What is the potential impact of a nuclear accident at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant?

## Summary
The Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant <font color=#FF3399>[1]</font> has been caught in a crossfire between Russia and Ukraine, and there are fears that any further damage could lead to a radiation disaster <font color=#FF3399>[2]</font>. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) <font color=#FF3399>[3]</font> has warned that any escalation affecting the six-reactor plant could result in a severe nuclear accident with potentially grave radiological consequences <font color=#FF3399>[4]</font>. The last operating reactor at the plant was shut down and disconnected from the grid <font color=#FF3399>[5]</font>, and the IAEA has since confirmed that it has been put into its safest state <font color=#FF3399>[5]</font>. Thus, a nuclear accident at the Zaporizhzhia plant could have devastating consequences, both economically and from a human health and environmental perspective.

|<font color=#FF3399>[1]</font> The damage to critical infrastructure around the facility has been significant, and there are fears more damage could lead to a radiation disaster in the country that still manages the cleanup of the Chornobyl nuclear disaster.<a href="https://graphics.reuters.com/UKRAINE-CRISIS/ZAPORIZHZHIA/mypmnznjqvr/" target="_blank">Source</a>| On the edge of the frontline in eastern Ukraine, Europes largest nuclear power station, the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, has been caught in a crossfire. Both Russia and Ukraine have accused each other of shelling dangerously close to the plant. The damage to critical infrastructure around the facility has been significant, and there are fears more damage could lead to a radiation disaster in the country that still manages the cleanup of the Chornobyl nuclear disaster. Experts from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) arrived at the plant on Thursday for an independent inspection after they were delayed by yet more shelling.|
|<font color=#FF3399>[2]</font> So there's this real risk that any radioactivity released would be potentially economically devastating as well.<a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/09/05/1121144977/a-sixth-reactor-at-ukraine-s-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-power-plant-is-now-off-the-gri" target="_blank">Source</a>| There would be no easy way to get international help to the plant. And if that's not scary enough, Zaporizhzhia sits in the middle of some of Ukraine's most fertile farmland. So there's this real risk that any radioactivity released would be potentially economically devastating as well. SHAPIRO: That's NPR's Geoff Brumfiel.|
|<font color=#FF3399>[3]</font> "Any further escalation affecting the six-reactor plant could lead to a severe nuclear accident with potentially grave radiological consequences for human health and the environment in Ukraine and elsewhere," the IAEA warned.<a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ukraine-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-power-plant-risks-chernobyl-comparison/" target="_blank">Source</a>| After the shutdown, Zaporizhzhia will enter a "cold state," according to Ukrainian nuclear operator Energoatom. But the integrity of the plant has been compromised by weeks of shelling, according to a 52-page report compiled by the United Nations-backed global nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which sent a team of inspectors to Zaporizhzhia at the beginning of September. "Any further escalation affecting the six-reactor plant could lead to a severe nuclear accident with potentially grave radiological consequences for human health and the environment in Ukraine and elsewhere," the IAEA warned. The agency's Director General, Rafael Grossi, noted in the report that the Ukrainian technicians who've continued operating the plant under Russian occupation are "under constant high stress and pressure, especially with the limited staff available."|
|<font color=#FF3399>[4]</font> The last operating reactor at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine has been completely shut down and disconnected from the grid, the Ukrainian operator Energoatom said on Sunday.<a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/zaporizhzhia-nuclear-power-plant-is-being-shut-down-operator-says/" target="_blank">Source</a>| The last operating reactor at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine has been completely shut down and disconnected from the grid, the Ukrainian operator Energoatom said on Sunday. "Arrangements for its cooling and transfer to a cold state are underway," Energoatom said, adding that in recent days the sixth and last operating reactor at the plant had been powering exclusively the facility's in-house needs because "all transmission lines linking the Zaporizhzhya NPP to the Ukrainian power system were damaged due to Russian shelling."|
|<font color=#FF3399>[5]</font> The last operating reactor at Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station has been put into its "safest state" and shut down after being reconnected to the country's electrical grid, the International Atomic Energy Agency announced in a statement on Sunday.<a href="https://www.axios.com/2022/09/11/ukraine-nuclear-zaporizhzhia-reactor" target="_blank">Source</a>| The last operating reactor at Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station has been put into its "safest state" and shut down after being reconnected to the country's electrical grid, the International Atomic Energy Agency announced in a statement on Sunday. Driving the news: The plant, which is Europe's largest nuclear power station, was disconnected from Ukraine's power grid last week amid shelling, and was operating on "island mode" for days by using its remaining reactor to generate enough electricity for critical cooling systems, AP reports.|
