|<font color=#FF3399>[1]</font> For weeks now, Ukraine and Russia have accused each other of endangering the plant's safety with artillery or drone strikes.<a href="https://graphics.reuters.com/UKRAINE-CRISIS/ZAPORIZHZHIA/mypmnznjqvr/" target="_blank">Source</a>| Russian forces captured the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in early March as part of what Moscow calls its "special military operation" in Ukraine. The plant is still operated by Ukrainian technicians working under "extremely stressful conditions," according to the IAEA. For weeks now, Ukraine and Russia have accused each other of endangering the plant's safety with artillery or drone strikes. Ukraine also accuses Russia of using it as a shield to launch attacks on Ukrainian-held territory, which Moscow denies.|
|<font color=#FF3399>[2]</font> The last operating reactor at Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station has been put into its "safest state" and shut down after being reconnected to the country's electrical grid, the International Atomic Energy Agency announced in a statement on Sunday.<a href="https://www.axios.com/2022/09/11/ukraine-nuclear-zaporizhzhia-reactor" target="_blank">Source</a>| The last operating reactor at Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station has been put into its "safest state" and shut down after being reconnected to the country's electrical grid, the International Atomic Energy Agency announced in a statement on Sunday. Driving the news: The plant, which is Europe's largest nuclear power station, was disconnected from Ukraine's power grid last week amid shelling, and was operating on "island mode" for days by using its remaining reactor to generate enough electricity for critical cooling systems, AP reports.|
|<font color=#FF3399>[3]</font> Russia has insisted the military presence at the plant is to protect it; Ukraine says that the Russians are using the territory of the plant to fire at Ukrainian-held territory on the other side of the river Dnipro.<a href="https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/russia-ukraine-war-news-09-02-22/h_e4926bf32f4c731f3858970a80fb040b" target="_blank">Source</a>| Some background: The plant and the area around it, including the adjacent city of Enerhodar, have endured persistent shelling that has raised fears of a nuclear accident through the interruption of the power supply to the facility. Each side accuses the other of acts of nuclear terrorism. Russia has insisted the military presence at the plant is to protect it; Ukraine says that the Russians are using the territory of the plant to fire at Ukrainian-held territory on the other side of the river Dnipro.

|<font color=#FF3399>[4]</font> The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said it plans to establish a permanent presence at theZaporizhzhianuclear power plant, where constant shelling has sparked fears of a nuclear accident.<a href="https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/russia-ukraine-war-news-09-01-22/h_fc32afbced04fedc49f3a34aae4aabfd" target="_blank">Source</a>| The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said it plans to establish a permanent presence at theZaporizhzhianuclear power plant, where constant shelling has sparked fears of a nuclear accident. The announcement from Rafael Grossi, the IAEA chief, came shortly after he and a team of 13 other experts arrived in the city of Zaporizhzhia Wednesday.|
|<font color=#FF3399>[5]</font> Both sides have accused each other of shelling it.<a href="https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/russia-ukraine-war-news-09-01-22/h_14c38fcbf23fc08839d2376030e3bf09" target="_blank">Source</a>| Upon arrival at the plant, the team will start an immediate "assessment of the security and safety situation," Grossi told reporters, with the ultimate goal of "establishing a continued presence of the IAEA at the plant." The plant is near the front line of the war in southeastern Ukraine and was captured by Russian troops in March. Both sides have accused each other of shelling it. It is uncertain how long the IAEA visit will last.|
