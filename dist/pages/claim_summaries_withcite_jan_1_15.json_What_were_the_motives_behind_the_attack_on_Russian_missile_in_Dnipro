# What were the motives behind the attack on Russian missile in Dnipro?

## Summary
The Russian missile attack on the city of Dnipro (context 4) on Saturday was part of the Kremlin's efforts to limit Ukraine's ability to heat and power itself in the middle of winter (context 1). The attack was reportedly carried out with a Kh-22 missile, an older and less accurate weapon than most modern missiles (context 2). It is believed that the attack was part of the Kremlin's attempts to retake a town, Soledar, and the nearby city of Bakhmut, as a way to grind down the best Ukrainian forces and prevent them from launching counterattacks elsewhere (context 3). Nine people were killed, including a 15-year old girl, Kyrylo Tymoshenko (context 5), and Russia denied responsibility for the attack, claiming it was caused by Ukrainian air defences (context 4).
