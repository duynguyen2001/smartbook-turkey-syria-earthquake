It has been the site of periodic fighting that has alarmed observers, including the International Atomic Energy Agency. The plant shut down the last of its six reactors in September but requires a steady source of electricity to maintain safeguards. The plant's former director, Ihor Murashov, ran the facility for seven months under Russian occupation.|

It already has a permanent team based at Zaporizhzhia plant, which has been under the control of the Russian military since early March. Grossi said: "We will be at these nuclear power plants in the near future as part of our steadfast assistance to Ukraine in its efforts to maintain nuclear safety and security and prevent a nuclear accident during the conflict." Nuclear power plants need power for essential cooling and safety functions, even if in shutdown and not producing electricity.|
