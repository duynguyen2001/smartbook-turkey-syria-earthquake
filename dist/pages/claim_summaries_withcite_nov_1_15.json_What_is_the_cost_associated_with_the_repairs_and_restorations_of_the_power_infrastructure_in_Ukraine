# What is the cost associated with the repairs and restorations of the power infrastructure in Ukraine?

## Summary
The cost of repairing and restoring Ukraine's power infrastructure is estimated to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars [1]. To help with the repairs, the government has received over 400 generators from international partners [2], with an additional 1,100 expected through a joint project with the World Bank and 170 more from the World Health Organization [3]. This damage was the result of roughly 50 Russian missiles that struck Ukrainian infrastructure facilities in a single day [4], and the consequences of the power and water shortages will only grow as winter approaches [5]. As a result, many Southeast Asian nations are looking to the United States for arms and military or diplomatic support against China, rather than purchasing from Russia, to signal a neutral position on the invasion of Ukraine [5].
