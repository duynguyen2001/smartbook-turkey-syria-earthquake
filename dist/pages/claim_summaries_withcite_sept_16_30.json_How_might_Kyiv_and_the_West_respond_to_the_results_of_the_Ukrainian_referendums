# How might Kyiv and the West respond to the results of the Ukrainian referendums?

## Summary
The referendums held in four occupied regions of Ukraine over the past four days, called by pro-Russian officials, have returned huge majorities in favor of joining the Russian Federation <font color=#FF3399>[1,2]</font>. However, these referendums have been strongly condemned by both the government of Ukraine and its allies in the West, who have deemed them a "sham" and against international law, with no independent monitors present <font color=#FF3399>[3,4,5]</font>. The European Union has said it won't recognize the results and has indicated it is preparing a new package of sanctions against Russia <font color=#FF3399>[1]</font>. Kyiv will likely respond by continuing its counteroffensive, which has recaptured swathes of territory, and the West is likely to respond with further sanctions against Russia <font color=#FF3399>[5]</font>.
