# What are the risks of an accident at the plant?

## Summary
The Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant in eastern Ukraine has been caught in the crossfire between Russia and Ukraine, with both sides accusing each other of shelling dangerously close to the plant <font color=#FF3399>[1]</font>. This has caused significant damage to critical infrastructure around the facility <font color=#FF3399>[2]</font>, and there is a risk of a severe nuclear accident with potentially grave radiological consequences if the shelling continues <font color=#FF3399>[3]</font>. To minimize this risk, the plant has been shut down and will enter a “cold state” <font color=#FF3399>[4]</font>, however there is only enough diesel fuel to power emergency generators for 10 days <font color=#FF3399>[5]</font>. Therefore, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has announced plans to establish a permanent presence at the plant <font color=#FF3399>[5]</font> to monitor the situation and help prevent a nuclear accident.

And if that's not scary enough, Zaporizhzhia sits in the middle of some of Ukraine's most fertile farmland. So there's this real risk that any radioactivity released would be potentially economically devastating as well. SHAPIRO: That's NPR's Geoff Brumfiel.|
|<font color=#FF3399>[2]</font> "Any further escalation affecting the six-reactor plant could lead to a severe nuclear accident with potentially grave radiological consequences for human health and the environment in Ukraine and elsewhere," the IAEA warned.<a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ukraine-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-power-plant-risks-chernobyl-comparison/" target="_blank">Source</a>| After the shutdown, Zaporizhzhia will enter a "cold state," according to Ukrainian nuclear operator Energoatom. But the integrity of the plant has been compromised by weeks of shelling, according to a 52-page report compiled by the United Nations-backed global nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which sent a team of inspectors to Zaporizhzhia at the beginning of September. "Any further escalation affecting the six-reactor plant could lead to a severe nuclear accident with potentially grave radiological consequences for human health and the environment in Ukraine and elsewhere," the IAEA warned. The agency's Director General, Rafael Grossi, noted in the report that the Ukrainian technicians who've continued operating the plant under Russian occupation are "under constant high stress and pressure, especially with the limited staff available."|
|<font color=#FF3399>[3]</font> The damage to critical infrastructure around the facility has been significant, and there are fears more damage could lead to a radiation disaster in the country that still manages the cleanup of the Chornobyl nuclear disaster.<a href="https://graphics.reuters.com/UKRAINE-CRISIS/ZAPORIZHZHIA/mypmnznjqvr/" target="_blank">Source</a>| On the edge of the frontline in eastern Ukraine, Europes largest nuclear power station, the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, has been caught in a crossfire. Both Russia and Ukraine have accused each other of shelling dangerously close to the plant. The damage to critical infrastructure around the facility has been significant, and there are fears more damage could lead to a radiation disaster in the country that still manages the cleanup of the Chornobyl nuclear disaster. Experts from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) arrived at the plant on Thursday for an independent inspection after they were delayed by yet more shelling.|
|<font color=#FF3399>[4]</font> Energoatom said the risk remains high that outside power is cut again, in which case the plant would have to fire up emergency diesel generators to keep the reactors cool and prevent a nuclear meltdown.<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/09/11/last-reactor-at-ukraines-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant-stopped-00056031" target="_blank">Source</a>| "Therefore, a decision was made to shut down power unit No. 6 and transfer it to the safest state cold shutdown," the company said in a statement. Energoatom said the risk remains high that outside power is cut again, in which case the plant would have to fire up emergency diesel generators to keep the reactors cool and prevent a nuclear meltdown. The companys chief told The Associated Press on Thursday that the plant only has diesel fuel for 10 days.|
