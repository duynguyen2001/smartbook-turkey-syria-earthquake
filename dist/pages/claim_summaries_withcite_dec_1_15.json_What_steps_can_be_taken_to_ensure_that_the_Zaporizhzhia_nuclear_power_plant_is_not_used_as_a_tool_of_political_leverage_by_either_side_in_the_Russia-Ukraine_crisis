## Summary
In order to protect the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant <font color=#FF3399>[1]</font> and avoid a nuclear accident <font color=#FF3399>[3]</font>, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and Rafael Grossi are working to reach an agreement with Russia and Ukraine over the demilitarization of the NPP <font color=#FF3399>[2]</font>. Both sides must remove any heavy weapons from the area <font color=#FF3399>[5]</font> and the IAEA is hoping to establish a safety zone around the station <font color=#FF3399>[4]</font>. This is a priority of the IAEA, as the plant is located in a region that has been deliberately targeted by Russia <font color=#FF3399>[5]</font>. The goal of the IAEA is to reach a solution as soon as possible, preferably by the end of the year <font color=#FF3399>[3]</font>.

International Atomic Energy Agency is trying to establish a safety zone around the plant because while nuclear power plants are built to withstand many natural disasters, few are designed to survive direct military attacks, said Edwin Lyman, a nuclear expert with the Union of Concerned Scientists.<a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2022/12/08/nuclear-disaster-russian-war-explained/8092631001/" target="_blank">Source</a>| A leak from Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant is among the highest risk, experts told USA TODAY, because Russia has deliberately targeted the area. Zaporizhzhia is Europe's largest nuclear power station and has been under Russian control since shortly after the invasion. The U.N. International Atomic Energy Agency is trying to establish a safety zone around the plant because while nuclear power plants are built to withstand many natural disasters, few are designed to survive direct military attacks, said Edwin Lyman, a nuclear expert with the Union of Concerned Scientists. An attack on the plant could potentially release intense radiation in a small area and weaker radioactive particles over a wider area.|
