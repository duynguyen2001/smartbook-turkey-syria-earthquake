# What are the potential consequences of the Nord Stream gas pipeline not being decommissioned?

## Summary
The Nord Stream gas pipeline, which is owned by the Russian gas giant Gazprom yet not in active service due to geopolitical issues, could potentially have a significant environmental impact if not decommissioned; it is estimated that the volume of gas that could have leaked from the pipeline could have resulted in up to 14 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (1). In an effort to address this issue, European countries have started strengthening security and surveillance around critical infrastructure (2), and Russian President Vladimir Putin has suggested that the lost volumes from the Nord Streams could be moved along the bottom of the Baltic Sea to the Black Sea region and create the largest gas hub for Europe in Turkey (3). However, due to Western sanctions and the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February, the pipeline has not been operational, and European countries are resistant to calls from Russia to drop their opposition to the project (4). The operator of the Nord Stream gas pipeline has reported that it is currently unable to inspect the damage caused by the gas leaks due to restrictions imposed by Swedish and Danish authorities, and it has been classified as an act of sabotage (5).

"That is, of course, if our partners are interested in this. And economic feasibility, of course." The problem is that European Union countries are trying to end their reliance on Russian oil and gas after Putin sent troops into Ukraine as part of what he calls a special military operation.|
