# How can the United States best pressure Russia to engage in good faith negotiations for the release of Paul Whelan and Brittney Griner?

## Summary
The United States is intensifying its efforts to secure the release of Paul Whelan and Brittney Griner, who have been detained in Russia for months. President Biden held separate meetings with Griner's wife Cherelle and Whelan's sister Elizabeth in the Oval Office to reiterate his commitment to work through all available avenues to bring them home safely (1). Griner pleaded guilty to drug smuggling charges in July in an effort to help her return to the states (2). The U.S. has offered a proposal to swap arms dealer Viktor Bout for Griner and Whelan, but has not received a response from Russia (3). John Kirby, a spokesman for the National Security Council, said the U.S. has made a "serious offer" to negotiate their release and that the president is not going to let up (4). A senior administration official said there has been "movement but not breakthrough" on the efforts to secure the releases of Griner and Whelan, and urged Russia to put forward "a serious counteroffer" to the proposal on the table (5).
