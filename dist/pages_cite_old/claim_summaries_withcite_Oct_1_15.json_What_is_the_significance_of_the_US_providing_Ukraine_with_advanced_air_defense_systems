# What is the significance of the US providing Ukraine with advanced air defense systems?

## Summary
The US is providing Ukraine with advanced air defense systems in order to protect the country from Russian aggression. President Biden discussed this with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in a call on Monday (1) and pledged continued US security assistance, including these advanced air defense systems (2). The White House did not specify which air defense systems were discussed, but the US previously committed to providing Ukraine with National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile Systems (NASAMS) which would be capable of engaging Russian cruise missiles (3). This shows the US' commitment to holding Russia accountable for its war crimes and atrocities (4) and also conveys the message that the US will never recognize Russia's purported annexation of Ukrainian territory (1).
