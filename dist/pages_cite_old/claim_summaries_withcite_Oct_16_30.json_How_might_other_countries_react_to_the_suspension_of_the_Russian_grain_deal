# How might other countries react to the suspension of the Russian grain deal?

## Summary
After drone attacks on Russian ships in Crimea, Russia suspended its participation in the UN-brokered Ukraine grain deal (1). Ukraine denied responsibility for the attacks, claiming that the Russians mishandled their own weapons (2). In response, U.N. chief Antonio Guterres urged Russia and Ukraine to renew the grain export deal (2) and for other countries, mainly in the West, to expedite the removal of obstacles blocking Russian grain and fertilizer exports (3). Russia has warned that the deployment of US nuclear bombs in Europe would lower the “nuclear threshold” (4). In light of this, it is expected that the international community, especially the UN and the G20, will likely take a strong stance in response to Russia's suspension of the grain deal (1).
