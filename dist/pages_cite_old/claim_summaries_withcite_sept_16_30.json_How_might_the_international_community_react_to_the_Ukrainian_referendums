# How might the international community react to the Ukrainian referendums?

## Summary
The referendums over the past four days in four occupied regions of Ukraine, called at short notice by pro-Russian authorities and not observed by independent monitors, have been widely condemned by Western governments and Kyiv as a "sham" and against international law (1). The referendums have returned huge majorities in favor of joining the Russian Federation, as confirmed by Russian state media (2). Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba has urged the European Union to impose further economic sanctions on Russia to punish it for staging the votes, which he said would not change Ukraine's actions on the battlefield (5). As such, the international community is likely to respond to the Ukrainian referendums with condemnation and sanctions.
