# What are the Ukrainian objectives in preventing the referendums from taking place?

## Summary
Ukraine is strongly opposed to the referendums being held in the occupied territories of Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia, as they are seen as illegitimate and a thin attempt to justify Russian annexation of the regions (1). The individuals suspected of organizing the polls are facing criminal charges for collaborating with Russia and encroaching on Ukraine's territorial integrity (2). Kyiv has vowed to impose “severe and swift costs” on Russia if it proceeds with the illegal annexation of the regions (3). Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has publicly stated that his country will not accept the “pseudo-referendums” and that the residents of the occupied territories have been forced to vote at gunpoint (4). Ukraine is actively pursuing its counteroffensive in the east and south in order to prevent Russia from swallowing up the four regions (5).
