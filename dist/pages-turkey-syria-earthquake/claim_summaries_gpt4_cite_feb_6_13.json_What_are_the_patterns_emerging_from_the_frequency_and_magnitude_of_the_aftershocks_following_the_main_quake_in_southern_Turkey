# What are the patterns emerging from the frequency and magnitude of the aftershocks following the main quake in southern Turkey?

## Summary
After the 7.8 magnitude earthquake hit southern Turkey, a significant number of aftershocks have occurred, ranging from 54 to 125, all measuring 4.0 or greater (Contexts 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5). As time progresses from the original earthquake, the frequency and magnitude of these aftershocks are expected to decrease (Contexts 1 and 2). However, aftershocks of magnitudes 5.0 to 6.0 or greater are still possible, which could potentially cause further damage to already compromised structures (Contexts 1 and 2). These aftershocks pose a continuing threat to rescue teams and survivors (Contexts 1 and 2). The aftershocks have been occurring along a fault zone in southern Turkey that extends from the Mediterranean Sea off the northern coast of Syria, up through the province of Malatya, with a range of 300-400 kilometers (Contexts 1 and 2). Some of the aftershocks have been as powerful as 6.0 or greater, including a 7.5 magnitude earthquake that struck 95 kilometers north of the original quake's epicenter (Contexts 3 and

Remember: All aftershocks are individual earthquakes. But as long as they are not stronger than the original, main quake, they are considered aftershocks. Separately, the United States Geological Survey (USGS), which only reports the more significant aftershocks that are actually felt by those in the earthquake zone, reported at least 43 aftershocks of 4.3 or greater magnitude.|
