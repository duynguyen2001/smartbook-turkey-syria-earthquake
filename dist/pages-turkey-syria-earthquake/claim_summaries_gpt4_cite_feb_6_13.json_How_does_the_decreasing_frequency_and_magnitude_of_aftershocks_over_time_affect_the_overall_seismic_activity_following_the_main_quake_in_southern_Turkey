# How does the decreasing frequency and magnitude of aftershocks over time affect the overall seismic activity following the main quake in southern Turkey?

## Summary
The main earthquake in southern Turkey was followed by at least 77 to 125 aftershocks of 4.0 magnitude or greater, as recorded by the United States Geological Survey <font color=#FF3399>[1,2,4]</font>. Over time, the frequency and magnitude of these aftershocks tend to decrease <font color=#FF3399>[1,2]</font>. However, there is still a risk of 5.0 to 6.0+ aftershocks, which could cause additional damage to structures already compromised by the main quake <font color=#FF3399>[1,2]</font>. The aftershocks have been felt for more than 300 to 400 kilometers along the fault zone that ruptured in southern Turkey, extending from southwest to northeast <font color=#FF3399>[1,2]</font>. Due to the nature of this seismic event, aftershocks could continue for weeks or even months <font color=#FF3399>[3]</font>. The persistent aftershocks and the subsequent damage they may cause present a continued threat to rescue teams, survivors, and those choosing between returning to potentially unstable homes or seeking shelter elsewhere <font color=#FF3399>[2,5]</font>.

The aftershocks stretch for more than 400 kilometers (or about 250 miles) along the fault zone that ruptured in southern Turkey, oriented from southwest to northeast and stretching from the Mediterranean Sea off the northern coast of Syria up through the province of Malatya.|
|<font color=#FF3399>[3]</font> Because of the nature of this seismic event, aftershocks could last "for weeks and months," according to CNN meteorologist Karen Maginnis.<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/07/middleeast/earthquake-turkey-syria-why-deadly-intl/index.html" target="_blank">Source</a>| "Why that matters is because the buildings dont want to go back and forth. And then the secondary waves begin to go back and forth as well," Myers added. Because of the nature of this seismic event, aftershocks could last "for weeks and months," according to CNN meteorologist Karen Maginnis. How does this quake compare globally?|

In addition, significant aftershocks continue to be felt across both countries meaning people have to face the agonizing choice of returning to homes that may collapse in an aftershock or seeking shelter elsewhere. Severe cold weather has only made matters worse with temperatures dropping below freezing at night, increasing the risk of hypothermia, and hampering relief efforts. How Were Responding|
