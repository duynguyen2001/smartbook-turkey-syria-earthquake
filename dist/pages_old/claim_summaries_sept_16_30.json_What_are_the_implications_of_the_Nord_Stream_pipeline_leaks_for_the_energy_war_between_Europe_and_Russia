# What are the implications of the Nord Stream pipeline leaks for the energy war between Europe and Russia?

## Summary
The Nord Stream pipeline leaks have implications for the energy war between Europe and Russia because they suggest that the pipelines are vulnerable to sabotage. This could cause gas prices to increase and shortages to occur. Additionally, the Kremlin is denying allegations that it is behind the damage, but this incident has sunk any remaining expectations that Europe could receive gas via Nord Stream 1 before the winter.

|"The significant drop in pressure that has already occurred in the Nord Stream 2 pipeline gives reason to fear that this is a major accident and that significant quantities of the dangerous greenhouse gas methane have already leaked into the Baltic Sea," said Mller-Kraenner.<a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/gas-leak-detected-near-nord-stream-2/" target="_blank">Source</a>| It is highly flammable and has such a potent global warming effect that it has been likened to "CO2 on steroids." "As soon as the gaseous methane rises above the sea surface into the atmosphere, it contributes massively to the greenhouse effect," said Sascha Mller-Kraenner, federal director of NGO Environmental Action Germany.
