Geng Shuang, Deputy Permanent Representative of China to the United Nations: All parties should abandon political self-interest and make practical efforts to resolve the Ukrainian crisis
China Daily, United Nations, September 7 (Reporter Zhang Minlu) On the 7th local time, the UN Security Council held a meeting to discuss the humanitarian issue in Ukraine. China's Deputy Permanent Representative to the United Nations, Geng Shuang, attended the meeting and said that all parties in the Ukraine crisis should abandon political self-interest, stop intensifying conflicts, stop creating divisions, stop advocating confrontation, and make practical efforts to resolve the crisis. Geng Shuang said that history has repeatedly proved that diplomatic efforts, negotiation and communication are the only correct way to resolve conflicts and end crises. China once again calls on the parties concerned to maintain dialogue and contacts, explore the possibility of a political settlement, and accumulate conditions for an early ceasefire and war and the restoration of peace and stability.
Geng Shuang pointed out that the safety and security of the Zaporozhye nuclear power plant concerns the health and well-being of hundreds of millions of people in Ukraine and the entire region, and accidents will never be tolerated. China calls on the parties concerned to earnestly implement the seven pillars proposed by Director General Grossi and refrain from taking actions that endanger nuclear safety and security. China welcomes the IAEA delegation's on-site inspection of the Zaporozhye nuclear power plant last week, appreciates the agency's experts staying at the nuclear power plant to continue their work, and encourages the agency to maintain communication with all parties on relevant issues.
