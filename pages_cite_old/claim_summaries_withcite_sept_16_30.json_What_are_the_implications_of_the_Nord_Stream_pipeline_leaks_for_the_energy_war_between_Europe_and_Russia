# What are the implications of the Nord Stream pipeline leaks for the energy war between Europe and Russia?

## Summary
The Nord Stream pipeline leaks have caused major implications in the energy war between Europe and Russia. Since August, Russia has halted all gas supplies to Europe via Nord Stream 1, citing Western sanctions as a pretext (3). The new Nord Stream 2 pipeline had not yet entered commercial operation (4). This incident has caused an increase in energy bills for households across the continent and is a warning that any disruption to energy, whether by accident, an act of nature, or intentional, could deepen and prolong the energy crisis in Europe and beyond (2). In addition, experts and the Kremlin have not ruled out the possibility of sabotage (1). The climate is also at risk since methane, a highly flammable gas, has been leaked into the Baltic Sea (5). European leaders have expressed concerns about the security situation in the Baltic Sea region (4).

|"The significant drop in pressure that has already occurred in the Nord Stream 2 pipeline gives reason to fear that this is a major accident and that significant quantities of the dangerous greenhouse gas methane have already leaked into the Baltic Sea," said Mller-Kraenner.<a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/gas-leak-detected-near-nord-stream-2/" target="_blank">Source</a>| It is highly flammable and has such a potent global warming effect that it has been likened to "CO2 on steroids." "As soon as the gaseous methane rises above the sea surface into the atmosphere, it contributes massively to the greenhouse effect," said Sascha Mller-Kraenner, federal director of NGO Environmental Action Germany. "The significant drop in pressure that has already occurred in the Nord Stream 2 pipeline gives reason to fear that this is a major accident and that significant quantities of the dangerous greenhouse gas methane have already leaked into the Baltic Sea," said Mller-Kraenner.
