# What are the possible motivations for the countries that are interested in the Nord Stream gas pipeline being decommissioned?

## Summary
The Nord Stream gas pipeline is a project connecting Russia and Germany through the Baltic Sea. It has been the subject of controversy due to its potential to increase Europe's reliance on Russian energy resources. Recently, Western leaders have called the incident of gas leaks on the pipeline a deliberate act and have vowed a strong response. (1) This has led to speculation as to who could have caused the damage and what their motivations might be.Novak has suggested that countries which have expressed negative positions towards the Nord Stream project, such as the United States, Ukraine, and Poland, could have an interest in decommissioning the pipelines. (2) This could be an attempt to pressure NATO countries to stop sending aid to Ukraine, as Moscow has already cut off gas supplies to Nord Stream 1 and reduced the gas sent by 40 percent. (3) Additionally, the pipeline could be seen as an obstacle to Europe's strategy to loosen the energy monopoly of Russian corporations like Gazprom. (4) Poland, in particular, has taken steps to reduce its reliance on Russian gas by investing in alternatives such as LNG and the Baltic Pipe. (5)

|---|---|
|According to Novak, the countries that took a negative position in relation to the Nord Stream project, the United States, Ukraine, and Poland, are interested in decommissioning the pipelines.<a href="https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/russia-ukraine-war-news-10-02-22/h_abbf7d68ece5f3740799beecedcd2341" target="_blank">Source</a>| Western leaders have called the incident a deliberate act and have vowed a strong response. The cause of the incident is still not confirmed. According to Novak, the countries that took a negative position in relation to the Nord Stream project, the United States, Ukraine, and Poland, are interested in decommissioning the pipelines. Novak said that "it is necessary first of all to figure out who did this, and we are sure that certain countries that previously expressed their positions are interested in this".|
|While accusations have abounded, the motives behind the damage are not yet known.<a href="https://www.universetoday.com/157996/the-methane-released-from-the-damaged-nord-stream-pipeline-is-visible-from-space/" target="_blank">Source</a>| Both pipelines are owned by Russia and were built to transport natural gas from Russia to Germany through the Baltic Sea. Officials have said the leaks were caused by deliberate action, not accidents, and were likely intentional sabotage. While accusations have abounded, the motives behind the damage are not yet known. Seismic disturbances in the Baltic Sea were detected, and officials said that while neither pipeline was transporting gas at the time of the blasts, they still contained pressurized methane, which is the main component of natural gas.|
|One possible motive would be to pressure NATO countries, facing a freezing winter, to stop sending aid to Ukraine; Russia could gain further concessions by agreeing to repair the damaged lines.<a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/military/a41412695/nord-stream-pipeline-sabotage-suspected/" target="_blank">Source</a>| Most recently, Moscow turned off the supply of gas to Nord Stream 1 for "maintenance" and cut the amount of gas sent by 40 percent . These moves are widely seen as retaliation on NATO countries, including Germany and Denmark, who have provided arms and other support to Ukraine. One possible motive would be to pressure NATO countries, facing a freezing winter, to stop sending aid to Ukraine; Russia could gain further concessions by agreeing to repair the damaged lines.

|The pipeline, along with new terminals in Poland and Latvia to receive shipments of liquefied natural gas and new regulations to increase interdependency and reduce barriers, is part of Europes broader strategy to loosen the energy monopoly once held by Russian state enterprises like Gazprom, said Benjamin L. Schmitt, a research associate at Harvard and former European energy security adviser at the U.S. State Department.<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/01/business/baltic-pipe-nord-stream.html" target="_blank">Source</a>| The pipeline, along with new terminals in Poland and Latvia to receive shipments of liquefied natural gas and new regulations to increase interdependency and reduce barriers, is part of Europes broader strategy to loosen the energy monopoly once held by Russian state enterprises like Gazprom, said Benjamin L.

But even the most robust energy networks can function only if they are secured, he added.|
|Together with supplies of liquefied natural gas (LNG), Baltic Pipe is central to Poland's plan to cut out Russian gas and become more energy independent.<a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/baltic-pipe-gas-calms-european-nerves-over-russian-shortfall-2022-10-07/" target="_blank">Source</a>| With winter approaching and Russian supplies on which Europe has relied for decades largely at a halt, Europe needs alternatives urgently. EU Commissioner for Energy Kadri Simson said on Sept. 27 the Baltic Pipe was vital to Europe's security of supply. Together with supplies of liquefied natural gas (LNG), Baltic Pipe is central to Poland's plan to cut out Russian gas and become more energy independent. The country stepped up its long-planned efforts after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which has led to an energy stand-off as the West imposed sanctions Moscow has blamed for disrupting energy supplies.|
