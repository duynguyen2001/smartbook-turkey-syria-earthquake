# What are the risks associated with the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant?

## Summary
The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (NPP) in southern Ukraine is at risk of a potential nuclear disaster (1,2) due to the Russian occupation of the plant, the intense shelling and explosions that have occurred in the area, and the lack of a sustained electricity supply to maintain its cooling operations (3,4). The recent reconnection to the national electricity grid has improved the power status of the plant (5), but the general situation remains precarious and shells continue to fall in the surrounding area (5).

|External power sources have been repeatedly knocked out, endangering the system that cools the nuclear reactors and raising the specter of a meltdown.<a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/09/15/1123304625/how-freaked-out-should-we-be-about-ukraines-nuclear-plant" target="_blank">Source</a>| This huge nuclear complex has been held by Russian forces since March, while the plant itself is being run by an increasingly ragged and exhausted Ukrainian workforce. There have been reports of those workers being mistreated and abused, even as shells have been falling on the complex itself. External power sources have been repeatedly knocked out, endangering the system that cools the nuclear reactors and raising the specter of a meltdown. On today's episode, NPR's Kat Lonsdorf reports from inside Ukraine on the latest developments, in conversation with NPR Science Correspondent Geoff Brumfiel.|
|Though the plant has been witnessing intense shelling and explosion, experts don't think anything disastrous would happen, at least for now.<a href="https://www.theweek.in/news/world/2022/09/28/russian-referendum-fate-of-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-power-plant-uncertain.html" target="_blank">Source</a>| With annexation on the cards, the fate of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (NPP) is uncertain. The plant, located on the eastern bank of the Dnipro river, has been under Russian control since the beginning of the war but is still being operated by Ukrainian workers. Though the plant has been witnessing intense shelling and explosion, experts don't think anything disastrous would happen, at least for now. Reason: Russia hopes to use the plant to serve its own electricity market.|
|In terms of safety, an NPP occupied by militants poses two kinds of risks: nuclear disaster and the spreading of radioactive materials.<a href="https://www.wilsoncenter.org/blog-post/why-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-power-plant-mattersfor-whole-world" target="_blank">Source</a>| The station itself is an important part of Ukraines economy and powers an important cluster of industrial production in the southern and eastern regions of the country. Risk of nuclear disaster In terms of safety, an NPP occupied by militants poses two kinds of risks: nuclear disaster and the spreading of radioactive materials. Any NPP needs a sustained electricity supply to maintain its cooling operations.|
|As the world watches the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant suffer "weeks of shelling," the potential for "another nuclear disaster on the scale of the Chernobyl explosion" looms large, writes Bard alum C Mandler 19 for CBS news.<a href="https://www.bard.edu/news/jonathan-becker-discusses-the-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-power-plant-chernobyl-and-the-war-in-ukraine-with-c-mandler-19-for-cbs-news-2022-09-20" target="_blank">Source</a>| As the world watches the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant suffer "weeks of shelling," the potential for "another nuclear disaster on the scale of the Chernobyl explosion" looms large, writes Bard alum C Mandler 19 for CBS news. The similarities between Chernobyl and Zaporizhzhia are as much organizational as they are structural, says Jonathan Becker, executive vice president and vice president for academic affairs for Bard College.|
|The nuclear facilitys "power status has improved over the past week," but the general situation at the plant "remains precarious," IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi said in a statement.<a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant-reconnected-to-ukraine-electricity-grid/" target="_blank">Source</a>| The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine has been reconnected to the national electricity grid after engineers repaired one of the four main external power lines damaged during the Russian invasion of the country, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said on Saturday. The nuclear facilitys "power status has improved over the past week," but the general situation at the plant "remains precarious," IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi said in a statement. "While there has been no recent shelling at or near the ZNPP, it continues to occur in the wider area," he said.|
