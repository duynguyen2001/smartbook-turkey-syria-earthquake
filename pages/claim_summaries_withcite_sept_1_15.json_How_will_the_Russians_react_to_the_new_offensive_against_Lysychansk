# How will the Russians react to the new offensive against Lysychansk?

## Summary
The Russians are feared to be retaliating against Ukraine's advancement in the Donbas region by launching air and missile strikes against civilian infrastructure. This has led to Ukrainian citizens fleeing the region, according to Haidai's reports of cars queueing up at checkpoints in towns such as Stanytsia Luhanska and Shchastia. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has acknowledged Kyiv's success in the offensive and has indicated that further territorial gains may be made if they receive more powerful weapons. As Ukrainian forces complete a sweep through much of what was Russian-held territory in Kharkiv region and make progress towards Lysychansk, the head of the so-called Donetsk People's Republic admits the situation in northern Donetsk has become "pretty tough" <font color=#FF3399>[3]</font> and that Russian officials are hastily retreating <font color=#FF3399>[4]</font>. The fear of further retaliation remains, with Zelenskyy noting that Moscow's strikes were aimed at depriving people of light and heat <font color=#FF3399>[2]</font>.

They had captured nearly all of Luhansk by early July of this year, but their efforts since to take control of neighboring Donetsk have stalled. That is in part because of a weekslong pause by Moscow in its offensive to rotate and refresh troops, but also because Ukraine has been preparing defensive positions in Donetsk since 2014 when rebels loyal to Russia seized government buildings there and in Luhansk, beginning a long trench war with Ukrainian forces that are difficult to dislodge. Ukrainian attacks on Russian ammunition depots and other supply points behind the front lines, using longer-range artillery supplied by Western countries, have also slowed Russias advances in Donetsk.|
