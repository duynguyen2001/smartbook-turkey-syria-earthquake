# What are the implications of the European investigation of the Nord Stream gas pipeline leaks?

## Summary
The European Union is investigating the explosions that damaged the Nord Stream 1 and 2 gas pipelines (Context 1) located near Denmark and Sweden (Context 4). The cause of the incident is still unknown, but it is suspected that it was an intentional act of sabotage (Context 3). Russia has suggested that the lost volumes of gas be rerouted to the Black Sea region and create a gas hub in Turkey (Context 2), while Poland has increased its patrols on the Baltic Sea (Context 5). These events have raised alarm among NATO and European countries, as the Nord Stream pipelines are Russia's most efficient means for conveying gas to Europe. (Context 5).

Investigation into the incidents is under way. Russia called it an "act of international terrorism", pointing the finger at the West, while the European Union called it a "sabotage". Both pipelines, stretching more than 1,000 km (620 miles) under the sea, were idle at the time of the ruptures.|

Putin said it was possible to repair the pipelines and that Russia and Europe should decide their fate. "We could move the lost volumes from the Nord Streams along the bottom of the Baltic Sea to the Black Sea region and thus make the main routes for the supply of our fuel, our natural gas to Europe through Turkey, creating the largest gas hub for Europe in Turkey," he told an energy conference in Moscow. "That is, of course, if our partners are interested in this.|

Both pipelines are owned by Russia and were built to transport natural gas from Russia to Germany through the Baltic Sea. Officials have said the leaks were caused by deliberate action, not accidents, and were likely intentional sabotage. While accusations have abounded, the motives behind the damage are not yet known.|

Western leaders have called the incident a deliberate act and have vowed a strong response. The cause of the incident is still not confirmed. According to Novak, the countries that took a negative position in relation to the Nord Stream project, the United States, Ukraine, and Poland, are interested in decommissioning the pipelines.|

Although they were each filled with limited amounts of gas, neither Nord Stream artery was transmitting the fuel at the time of the attack, because Russia had shut off 1 and Germany had never allowed 2 to begin operation. The suspected attacks on the pipelines alarmed NATO and European countries, which have increased their patrols on the Baltic Sea. The Polish company that operates Baltic Pipe, Gaz-System, said that together with Polish authorities, the undersea stretch of the new pipeline was under surveillance "on an ongoing basis by specialized operational services."|
