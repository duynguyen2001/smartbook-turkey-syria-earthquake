# What is the status of the nuclear power plant?

## Summary
The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP) in southern Ukraine has been completely shut down and disconnected from the grid. <font color=#FF3399>[1]</font> After the transmission line linking the plant to Ukraine's power system was restored, the plant's last operating reactor was powered exclusively by the facility's in-house needs before it was completely shut down and transferred to a cold state. <font color=#FF3399>[2]</font> On Tuesday, however, a backup power line was damaged due to shelling, prompting the head of the U.N. atomic watchdog to call for the establishment of an immediate safety zone around the plant to prevent a nuclear accident. <font color=#FF3399>[3,4]</font> The reactor was eventually put into a cold shutdown after an external power line was restored, ensuring the plant could be shut down safely. <font color=#FF3399>[5]</font>

|<font color=#FF3399>[1]</font> The last operating reactor at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine has been completely shut down and disconnected from the grid, the Ukrainian operator Energoatom said on Sunday.<a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/zaporizhzhia-nuclear-power-plant-is-being-shut-down-operator-says/" target="_blank">Source</a>| The last operating reactor at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine has been completely shut down and disconnected from the grid, the Ukrainian operator Energoatom said on Sunday. "Arrangements for its cooling and transfer to a cold state are underway," Energoatom said, adding that in recent days the sixth and last operating reactor at the plant had been powering exclusively the facility's in-house needs because "all transmission lines linking the Zaporizhzhya NPP to the Ukrainian power system were damaged due to Russian shelling."|
|<font color=#FF3399>[2]</font> The plant, the largest nuclear complex of its kind in Europe, was "completely shut down" after the plant's number 6 power unit was disconnected from the grid at 3:41 a.m. local time, the agency said in a statement, adding that "arrangements for its cooling and transfer to a cold state are underway."<a href="https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/russia-ukraine-war-news-09-11-22/h_c44c18e57c9e32b7b59404641307e889" target="_blank">Source</a>| The last operating reactor at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP) has been shut down after a transmission line linking the plant to Ukraine's power system was restored, the country's nuclear agency Energoatom said on Sunday. The plant, the largest nuclear complex of its kind in Europe, was "completely shut down" after the plant's number 6 power unit was disconnected from the grid at 3:41 a.m. local time, the agency said in a statement, adding that "arrangements for its cooling and transfer to a cold state are underway." Energoatom said that one of the transmission lines was restored to its operational capacity Saturday, making it possible to power the plant from Ukraine's energy system and shut down the number 6 power unit and transfer it to the "safest state cold shutdown."|

The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant has been held by Russian forces since early March, but is still operated by Ukrainian staff. The IAEA director general visited the power plant last week, and two IAEA experts stayed to maintain a permanent presence at the plant.|

That prompted the head of the U.N. atomic watchdog to call for the establishment of an immediate safety zone around the plant to prevent a nuclear accident. The six-reactor Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant came under the control of Russian forces early in the war but is being operated by Ukrainian staff. The plant and surrounding areas have been repeatedly hit by shelling that Russia and Ukraine blame on each other.|

The lack of external power to Europe's biggest nuclear plant had removed what are effectively lines of defence guarding against a nuclear meltdown at the site, which has been subject to fierce fighting in recent weeks.|
