# How will the capture of Soledar affect the morale of Ukrainian forces in the region?

## Summary
The capture of Soledar by Russian forces would represent a symbolic if not strategic victory for Moscow <font color=#FF3399>[1]</font>, and could boost the morale of the ultra-nationalist mercenary leader Yevgeny Prigozhin's Wagner Group of fighters-for-hire <font color=#FF3399>[5]</font>. However, the significance of Soledar in military terms is minimal <font color=#FF3399>[3, 4]</font> and its capture would not suggest a significant capitulation of Ukrainian forces, nor a substantial change to the overall complexion of the war <font color=#FF3399>[1]</font>. Ukraine's armed forces have denied Moscow's claim <font color=#FF3399>[2]</font> and US National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby has stated that the capture of Soledar would not have a strategic impact on the war <font color=#FF3399>[4]</font>. Thus, while the capture of Soledar may boost the morale of certain Russian forces, it is unlikely to have a major impact on the morale of Ukrainian forces in the region.
