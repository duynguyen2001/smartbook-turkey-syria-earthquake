# What are the potential consequences for Germany's security and the regional security of Europe if Germany decides to send tanks to Ukraine?

## Summary
Germany's decision to send tanks to Ukraine has caused a standoff between the Biden administration and Germany, with the US unwilling to agree to send its M1 Abrams tanks due to logistical costs <font color=#FF3399>[2]</font>. This has led to a larger debate between the US and its European allies over whether to send increasingly sophisticated weaponry to Ukraine, including longer-range missiles <font color=#FF3399>[3]</font>. Britain's Foreign Secretary James Cleverly has argued it is a "moral imperative" to provide Ukraine with high-performance tanks to fight Russia <font color=#FF3399>[4]</font>. However, Germany is reluctant to do so due to their own slim defense capabilities and fears of leaving themselves vulnerable <font color=#FF3399>[5]</font>. As a result, the potential consequences for Germany's security and the regional security of Europe remain to be seen <font color=#FF3399>[1]</font>.
