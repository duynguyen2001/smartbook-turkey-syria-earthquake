# What impact could the recent Quran-burning incident have on the NATO bid process for Turkey, Sweden and Finland?

## Summary
Recent incidents in Sweden have reignited tensions between Turkey and Sweden, with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan using the Quran-burning incident <font color=#FF3399>[2]</font> to push the issue of NATO expansion into the domestic political sphere. Turkish government issued a travel warning for European countries due to anti-Turkish demonstrations and what it described as Islamophobia <font color=#FF3399>[4]</font>. Ankara had already previously dragged its feet on pledging support for the accession bid, seeking conditions for approval such as the extradition of 130 political opponents from Sweden and Finland <font color=#FF3399>[5]</font>. As a result of this, it is unclear what impact the Quran-burning incident could have on the NATO bid process for Turkey, Sweden and Finland, as Sweden has downplayed the dispute and Hungary has pledged to ratify the joint NATO bid, while Turkey is yet to do so. <font color=#FF3399>[1, 3, 4, 5]</font>
