## Claims

|---|---|
|<font color=#FF3399>[1]</font> The capture of Soledar would represent a symbolic if not an especially strategic win for Putin after a long string of military setbacks dating back to last summer.<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/01/13/europe/russians-capture-soledar-intl/index.html" target="_blank">Source</a>| CNN Russia said Friday its forces had taken the small town of Soledar in eastern Ukraine following weeks of fierce fighting, in what would be Moscows first notable victory in months, although Ukraine denied the claim. The capture of Soledar would represent a symbolic if not an especially strategic win for Putin after a long string of military setbacks dating back to last summer. But it does not suggest a significant capitulation of Ukrainian forces, nor a substantial change to the overall complexion of the war.|

Russia said the capture of Soledar was"important for the continuation of successful offensive operations in the Donetsk region." It added that "establishing control over Soledar makes it possible to cut off the supply routes for Ukrainian troops in Bakhmut." The significance of Soledar in military terms is minimal.|
|<font color=#FF3399>[3]</font> "Even if both Bakhmut and Soledar fall to the Russians, it's not going to have a strategic impact on the war itself," U.S. National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby told reporters at the White House, "and it certainly isn't going to stop the Ukrainians or slow them down."<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/ukraine-fights-russian-assault-salt-mining-town-along-eastern-front-2023-01-09/" target="_blank">Source</a>| The capture of the entire region is widely seen as a Kremlin war objective. Kyiv's Western allies, however, see it as a fight for marginal gains on a stretch of front where neither side can make a big breakthrough, a sideshow from battles further north and south, where Ukraine hopes to push through Russian lines. "Even if both Bakhmut and Soledar fall to the Russians, it's not going to have a strategic impact on the war itself," U.S. National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby told reporters at the White House, "and it certainly isn't going to stop the Ukrainians or slow them down." Within Russia, victory in Soledar could boost ultra-nationalist mercenary leader Yevgeny Prigozhin, whose Wagner Group of fighters-for-hire, including convicts recruited from prison with promises of pardons, has focused on the fight in that area.|

Fighting isstill raging in Soledar,a salt mine town in eastern Ukraine, despite Russian claims that it has gained control of the region. The significance of Soledar in military terms is minimal. However, its capture would allow Russian forces, and especiallythe Wagner mercenary group, to turn their focus on nearby Bakhmut, which has been a target since the summer.|
|<font color=#FF3399>[5]</font> The capture of Soledar, despite its now-ruined state, would therefore be rare progress.<a href="https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/russia-ukraine-war-news-1-11-23/h_13bb32f230056ee1552eeda2bb162e1f" target="_blank">Source</a>| Moscow has struggled for months to attack Bakhmut from the east, but were it to capture Soledar, Moscow would at least be able to approach the city from a different path. The Russian armed forces have had nothing to celebrate since the beginning of July, and have had to retreat in both Kharkiv to the north and Kherson in southern Ukraine. The capture of Soledar, despite its now-ruined state, would therefore be rare progress. But it would be symbolic rather than substantive.|
