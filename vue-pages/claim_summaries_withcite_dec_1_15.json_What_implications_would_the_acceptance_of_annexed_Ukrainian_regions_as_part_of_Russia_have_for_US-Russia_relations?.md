# What implications would the acceptance of annexed Ukrainian regions as part of Russia have for US-Russia relations?

## Summary
The US' refusal to recognise the four illegally annexed Ukrainian regions by Russia as part of its territory has complicated potential talks between US President Joe Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin, as stated by Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov <font color=#FF3399>[2]</font>. This has been reiterated by Biden's statement that the only way for Putin to end the war in Ukraine is to “pull out”, and the support for the Ukrainian people from French President Emmanuel Macron <font color=#FF3399>[4, 5]</font>. This has caused tension and instability between the two countries, and the recognition of these regions could potentially ease tensions and create a basis for dialogue.
