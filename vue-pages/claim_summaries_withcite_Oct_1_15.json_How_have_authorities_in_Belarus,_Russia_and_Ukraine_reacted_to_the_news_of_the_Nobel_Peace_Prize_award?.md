# How have authorities in Belarus, Russia and Ukraine reacted to the news of the Nobel Peace Prize award?

## Summary
The 2022 Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to the organization Viasna, the human rights group Memorial, and Belarusian activist Ales Bialiatski, who has been detained without trial since 2020, for their "outstanding effort to document war crimes, human right abuses and the abuse of power" in Ukraine, Russia, and Belarus.1 This marks the first time a Nobel has gone to a Ukrainian person or organization, and the prize is seen as a rebuke to Russian President Vladimir Putin, coming just three days after a barrage of missile strikes by Russian forces on Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities.2 Belarus has sided with Russia in the conflict, and both governments have sought to silence democratic movements in their countries.3 In response to the prize, the head of the Center for Civil Liberties, Oleksandra Matviichuk, has called for an international tribunal to bring Putin, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, and “other war criminals to justice.”4 The Nobel committee has noted that the prize money of 10,000,000 Swedish Krona ($900,000) will be shared by the three winners.5
