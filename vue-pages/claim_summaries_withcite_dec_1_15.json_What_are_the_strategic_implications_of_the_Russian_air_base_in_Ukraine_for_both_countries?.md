# What are the strategic implications of the Russian air base in Ukraine for both countries?

## Summary
The Ukrainian Air Force conducted a series of long-range strikes on December 5, targeting two Russian military airbases near Moscow, Engels-2 and Dyagilevo <font color=#FF3399>[2]</font>. The strikes were carried out using modified Soviet-era unmanned aerial vehicles <font color=#FF3399>[3]</font>. This was the first instance in which Ukrainian forces had targeted Russia deep within its own territory <font color=#FF3399>[3]</font>. The attacks were a significant blow to the Kremlin and demonstrated Ukraine's ability to put Russia under threat <font color=#FF3399>[1]</font>. In response, the Russian Defense Ministry reported that its air defenses intercepted the attack <font color=#FF3399>[4]</font>. However, some of the missiles did manage to reach their targets, leading to infrastructure damage in both Kryvyi Rih and Odesa <font color=#FF3399>[5]</font>. This event has clear strategic implications for both countries, as it calls into question Russian air defense, security procedures and highlights Ukraine's capacity to threaten Russian territory.

This is where they perhaps can have nuclear weapons as well. And to be able to strike so deep into Russian territory really calls into question Russian air defense, Russia's security procedures.

For instance, the Khalino airfield near Kursk, where the fuel depot was hit on December 6, used to be a civilian facility, but since the start of the war, it has been used exclusively for military purposes (Svoboda, December 6). What is particularly significant about the strike on the Engels air base is the fact that it is a major facility for Russian strategic aviation, and as such, many Moscow commentators have emphasized the first-ever direct hit on an element of the strategic triad, pivotally important for national security (Nezavisimaya gazeta, December 7). The squadrons of Tu-95MS and Tu-160 bombers based in Engels (which appear to be a rare observers of a sadly dilapidated locale) are constantly used for launching cruise missiles on Ukrainian territory from a safe distance usually over the Caspian Sea, which veils the misfiring missiles making it a legitimate target for Ukrainian retaliation (Novayagazeta.eu, December 7).|
