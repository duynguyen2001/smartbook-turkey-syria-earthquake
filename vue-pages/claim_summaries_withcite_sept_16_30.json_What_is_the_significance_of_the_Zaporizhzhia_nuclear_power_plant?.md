# What is the significance of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant?

## Summary
The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant <font color=#FF3399>[1,2]</font> is the largest nuclear power station in Europe and is located in the south of Ukraine. It is an important part of Ukraine's economy <font color=#FF3399>[1]</font> and provides around half of the country's electricity <font color=#FF3399>[3]</font>. It has been under Russian control since the beginning of the war but is still being operated by Ukrainian workers <font color=#FF3399>[2]</font>. Recently, one of the four main power lines was repaired and is now supplying the plant with electricity from the Ukrainian grid <font color=#FF3399>[4]</font>. However, shelling has temporarily forced reactor number six to rely on emergency diesel generators for power <font color=#FF3399>[5]</font>. With the main power line now restored, the three back-up power lines are being held in reserve <font color=#FF3399>[4]</font>. This plant is important to Ukraine's economy and energy security, as well as Europe's energy security, as it provides electricity to the European Union to help decrease gas consumption to withstand Russia's energy blackmailing <font color=#FF3399>[1]</font>.

## Claims

|<font color=#FF3399>[1]</font> The station itself is an important part of Ukraines economy and powers an important cluster of industrial production in the southern and eastern regions of the country.<a href="https://www.wilsoncenter.org/blog-post/why-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-power-plant-mattersfor-whole-world" target="_blank">Source</a>| But if Ukraines power system loses Zaporizhzhia NPP, Ukraine will have to use other reserves or maybe even restrict consumption in the winter. And clearly, there will be no export of electricity to the European Union, which is suffering from Russian gas undersupply and needs electricity to decrease gas consumption and withstand Russias energy blackmailing. The station itself is an important part of Ukraines economy and powers an important cluster of industrial production in the southern and eastern regions of the country. Risk of nuclear disaster|

The Russian proxy government claims the local poll body in the southern Zaporizhzhia region had 93.11 per cent of voters opting for Russian annexation. With annexation on the cards, the fate of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (NPP) is uncertain. The plant, located on the eastern bank of the Dnipro river, has been under Russian control since the beginning of the war but is still being operated by Ukrainian workers.|

Ukraine relies heavily on nuclear power about half of its electricity comes from 15 nuclear reactors at four plants across the country, according to the World Nuclear Association. The Russian-controlled plant, with six reactors, is the largest nuclear power station in Europe. It was mostly built in the Soviet era and became Ukrainian property after its declaration of independence from the Soviet Union in 1991.|

"Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP) is once again receiving electricity directly from the national grid after engineers repaired one of the four main external power lines that have all been damaged during the conflict," International Atomic Energy Agency Director General Rafael Grossi confirmed Saturday. Grossi said that the restored line is now "providing Europe's largest nuclear power plant with the electricity it needs for reactor cooling and other essential safety functions." "With the main line's re-connection yesterday afternoon, the three back-up power lines are again being held in reserve," according to the IAEA.|

The five other reactors were not affected and continued " to receive power directly from the plant's off-site power line that was restored last week," IAEA added. The plant in southern Ukraine, with six reactors, is the largest nuclear power station in Europe. It was mostly built in the Soviet era and became Ukrainian property after its declaration of independence from the Soviet Union in 1991.|
