# What is the role of the US, UK and other European countries in the NATO bid of Sweden and Finland?

## Summary
The US, UK and other European countries have provided "security assurances" to Sweden and Finland <font color=#FF3399>[2]</font> to help them with their NATO bids in the face of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. In addition, Turkey, a NATO member, must approve the bids of the two countries. However, the recent burning of a Quran at a protest outside the Turkish Embassy in Stockholm <font color=#FF3399>[3]</font> has strained relations between Sweden and Turkey, with Erdogan now implying that Turkey may respond differently to Finland's NATO bid than to Sweden's <font color=#FF3399>[5]</font>. To gain approval from Turkey, Sweden must first take a clearer stance against what Turkey sees as terrorists, mainly Kurdish militants and a group it blames for a 2016 coup attempt <font color=#FF3399>[1]</font>.
