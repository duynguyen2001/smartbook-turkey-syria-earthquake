# How could the price cap on Russian oil be effective?

## Summary
A price cap on Russian oil could be effective if it can be implemented with wider international support and the participation of key importers such as China, India, and Turkey <font color=#FF3399>[3]</font>. This measure is designed to restrict the amount of revenue the Kremlin receives, while avoiding supply disruptions <font color=#FF3399>[1]</font>. The G7 group of countries agreed in principle to apply a price cap to the trading of Russian oil from December and this has triggered a possible energy crisis in the EU <font color=#FF3399>[2]</font>. The cap is designed to prevent a skyrocketing oil price from the EU's complete ban on seaborne Russian oil <font color=#FF3399>[3]</font>. If the cap forces Russia to strike cheaper deals with trading partners, it will still achieve its goals <font color=#FF3399>[5]</font>.

It comes as part of Russias escalating efforts to turn the Wests sanctions against itself by weaponizing hydrocarbon exports but while the high oil prices (themselves partly driven by sanctions) have proven a boon to Russia, it is gas supplies that have proven the most effective weapon. Russias latest move is especially effective given the energy crisis in the EU: through curbing supplies to Europe, Russia can both push gas prices even higher and deprive Europe of a key commodity ahead of what Moscow no doubt hopes will be a cold, hard winter.
