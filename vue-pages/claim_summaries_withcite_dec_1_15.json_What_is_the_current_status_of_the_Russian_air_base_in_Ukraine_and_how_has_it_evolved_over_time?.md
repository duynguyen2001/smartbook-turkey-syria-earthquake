# What is the current status of the Russian air base in Ukraine and how has it evolved over time?

## Summary
The Russian air base in Ukraine has evolved significantly since the start of the war. <font color=#FF3399>[1]</font> Initially, the Khalino airfield near Kursk was a civilian facility, but it has since been used for military purposes. <font color=#FF3399>[1]</font> On December 6, it was hit in a Ukrainian retaliation attack. <font color=#FF3399>[2]</font> In addition, the strategic Engels air base, a major facility for Russian strategic aviation, was also hit in a direct strike. <font color=#FF3399>[3]</font> This was significant as it was the first-ever direct hit on an element of the strategic triad, an important part of Russian national security. <font color=#FF3399>[3]</font> Ukraine has claimed to have intercepted more than 60 Russian missiles, and the shelling has caused water and electricity outages in Kryvyi Rih and Odesa. <font color=#FF3399>[4]</font> Despite Russia's nuclear blustering earlier in the conflict, world leaders have advocated for Moscow to tone down the rhetoric. <font color=#FF3399>[5]</font> To this day, Russia continues to strike Ukrainian civilian infrastructure repeatedly and constantly. <font color=#FF3399>[5]</font>

|<font color=#FF3399>[1]</font> What is particularly significant about the strike on the Engels air base is the fact that it is a major facility for Russian strategic aviation, and as such, many Moscow commentators have emphasized the first-ever direct hit on an element of the strategic triad, pivotally important for national security (Nezavisimaya gazeta, December 7).<a href="https://blogs.prio.org/2022/12/as-ukraine-conducts-deep-strikes-russia-turns-to-iran/" target="_blank">Source</a>| Using these capabilities for attacks deep within Russian territory, the Ukrainian command takes care to target military bases and assets, in sharp contrast with indiscriminate Russian attacks on Ukrainian civilian infrastructure and residential areas. For instance, the Khalino airfield near Kursk, where the fuel depot was hit on December 6, used to be a civilian facility, but since the start of the war, it has been used exclusively for military purposes (Svoboda, December 6). What is particularly significant about the strike on the Engels air base is the fact that it is a major facility for Russian strategic aviation, and as such, many Moscow commentators have emphasized the first-ever direct hit on an element of the strategic triad, pivotally important for national security (Nezavisimaya gazeta, December 7). The squadrons of Tu-95MS and Tu-160 bombers based in Engels (which appear to be a rare observers of a sadly dilapidated locale) are constantly used for launching cruise missiles on Ukrainian territory from a safe distance usually over the Caspian Sea, which veils the misfiring missiles making it a legitimate target for Ukrainian retaliation (Novayagazeta.eu, December 7).|

There's been a number of world leaders in addition to Western leaders in India and China that have also advocated or pushed Moscow to tone down the nuclear rhetoric. And that right now is the one way that Russia has to escalate this conflict, because it is - it has escalated. It is striking Ukrainian civilian infrastructure repeatedly and constantly.|
