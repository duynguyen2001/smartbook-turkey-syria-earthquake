# What are the implications of Russia suspending its participation in the Black Sea grain deal?

## Summary
Russia has suspended its participation in the Black Sea Grain Initiative <font color=#FF3399>[2]</font>, a UN-brokered deal that has allowed the export of more than nine million metric tons of grain and other food products to populations around the world <font color=#FF3399>[3]</font>. This deal was credited with lowering global food prices and providing relief to those in need <font color=#FF3399>[3]</font>. Before the war, Russia and Ukraine accounted for almost 30% of global trade in wheat, with Ukraine also being the world's fourth-largest exporter of corn and fifth-largest exporter of wheat <font color=#FF3399>[5]</font>. The blockade of Black Sea ports earlier this year stalled millions of tons of grain exports from Ukraine <font color=#FF3399>[5]</font>. The suspension of the deal could lead to a decrease in global food supplies <font color=#FF3399>[1]</font>. Ukraine has exported 8 million tons of food by sea since July <font color=#FF3399>[5]</font> and is likely to be most affected by the suspension <font color=#FF3399>[4]</font>.
