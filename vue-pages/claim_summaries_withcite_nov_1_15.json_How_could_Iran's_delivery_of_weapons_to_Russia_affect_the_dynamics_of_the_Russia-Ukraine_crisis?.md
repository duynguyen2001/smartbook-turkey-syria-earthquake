# How could Iran's delivery of weapons to Russia affect the dynamics of the Russia-Ukraine crisis?

## Summary
Iran is preparing to send approximately 1,000 additional weapons, including surface-to-surface short range ballistic missiles and attack drones, to Russia <font color=#FF3399>[1]</font> to use in its war against Ukraine. This shipment of advanced precision guided missiles could give the Kremlin a substantial boost on the battlefield <font color=#FF3399>[2]</font>. The last shipment of weapons from Iran to Russia included about 450 drones, which the Russians have already used to deadly effect in Ukraine <font color=#FF3399>[3]</font>. The US and at least one allied nation have observed indications that Iran is preparing to transfer the weapons <font color=#FF3399>[4]</font>. However, it is often the case that the Revolutionary Guard Corps, an elite military entity that answers only to the supreme leader, makes decisions on weapons and overseas conflicts independently of the Foreign Ministry <font color=#FF3399>[5]</font>. This move could trigger yet more Western sanctions, which the US and EU have already done over Iran's drone sales to Russia. Furthermore, Kyiv has downgraded its diplomatic ties with Tehran as a result <font color=#FF3399>[5]</font>.
