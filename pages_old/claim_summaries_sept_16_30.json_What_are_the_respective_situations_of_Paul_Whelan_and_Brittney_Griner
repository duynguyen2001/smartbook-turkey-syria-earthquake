# What are the respective situations of Paul Whelan and Brittney Griner?

## Summary
Paul Whelan has been imprisoned in Russia for more than three years after being convicted on espionage charges that he vehemently denies. He was sentenced in June 2020 to 16 years in prison in a trial US officials denounced as unfair. The United States has urged Russia to put forward "a serious counteroffer" to the proposal on the table to secure the release of the two, but "we've not gotten a serious response back."
Brittney Griner was sentenced last month to nine years in prison after pleading guilty and has appealed the punishment. Whelan is serving a 16-year sentence on espionage-related charges that he and his family say are false. The U.S. government regards both as wrongfully detained, placing their cases with the office of its top hostage negotiator. Secretary of State Antony Blinken took the unusual step of announcing two months ago that the administration had made a substantial proposal to Russia.
