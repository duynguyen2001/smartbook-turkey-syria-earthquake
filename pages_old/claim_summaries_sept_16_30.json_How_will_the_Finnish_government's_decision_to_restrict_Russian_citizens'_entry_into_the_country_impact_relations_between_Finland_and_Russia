# How will the Finnish government's decision to restrict Russian citizens' entry into the country impact relations between Finland and Russia?

## Summary
Finland's government has said that it will significantly restrict the right of Russian citizens to enter the country as tourists or as transit when traveling to other parts of the Schengen area. This move comes after Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the subsequent closure of many of the country's borders by Western nations. Finnish Prime Minister Sanna Marin said on Thursday that the government is assessing risks posed by individuals travelling through Finland, and is considering ways to sharply reduce Russian transit. In the short term, the government's decision is likely to cause an increase in the number of Russians seeking to enter the EU illegally.
