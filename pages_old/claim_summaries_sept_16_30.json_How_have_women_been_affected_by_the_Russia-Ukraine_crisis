# How have women been affected by the Russia-Ukraine crisis?

## Summary
The Russia-Ukraine crisis has disproportionately affected women, with more than half of the protesters detained in connection with the crisis being women. This is believed to be the largest anti-government protest by share of women in recent history. The government has said that punishment for refusing the draft is now 15 years in jail, which has led to many young men fleeing the country.
