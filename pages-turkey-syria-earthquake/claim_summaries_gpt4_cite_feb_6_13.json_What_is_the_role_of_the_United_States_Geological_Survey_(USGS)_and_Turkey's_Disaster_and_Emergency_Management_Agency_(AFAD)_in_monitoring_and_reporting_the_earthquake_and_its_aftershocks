# What is the role of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and Turkey's Disaster and Emergency Management Agency (AFAD) in monitoring and reporting the earthquake and its aftershocks?

## Summary
The United States Geological Survey (USGS) plays a crucial role in monitoring and reporting earthquakes and their aftershocks, as seen in the recent 7.8 magnitude earthquake in southern Turkey. The USGS has reported on the number of aftershocks measuring 4.0 or greater that have occurred since the initial quake, with some reports indicating at least 54, 77, and even up to 100 such aftershocks (Contexts 1, 3, 5). The agency also reported that three of these aftershocks measured 6.0 or greater, including a 7.5 magnitude earthquake that struck 95 kilometers north of the epicenter (Contexts 1, 2, 3, 5). It is important to note that all aftershocks are considered individual earthquakes unless they are stronger than the original quake (Context 2). The USGS uses seismographs to measure earthquakes and now follows the Modified Mercalli Intensity Scale (MMI), a more accurate measure of a quake's size (Context 4). Turkey's Disaster and Emergency Management Agency (AFAD) is not directly mentioned in the provided contexts, therefore its role cannot be accurately derived from the given information.

Three of the aftershocks have measured 6.0 or greater, including the massive 7.5 magnitude earthquake that struck 95 kilometers (about 59 miles) north of the epicenter of the morning's main quake.|
|<font color=#FF3399>[2]</font> Separately, the United States Geological Survey (USGS), which only reports the more significant aftershocks that are actually felt by those in the earthquake zone, reported at least 43 aftershocks of 4.3 or greater magnitude.<a href="https://www.cnn.com/middleeast/live-news/turkey-earthquake-latest-020623/h_4a110263beaf94827b0998a15d8d799d" target="_blank">Source</a>| Remember: All aftershocks are individual earthquakes. But as long as they are not stronger than the original, main quake, they are considered aftershocks. Separately, the United States Geological Survey (USGS), which only reports the more significant aftershocks that are actually felt by those in the earthquake zone, reported at least 43 aftershocks of 4.3 or greater magnitude. Three of the aftershocks measured 6.0 or greater, including the massive 7.5 magnitude earthquake that struck 95 kilometers (59 miles) north of the epicenter of the morning's main quake, according to USGS.|

|<font color=#FF3399>[4]</font> Earthquakes are measured using seismographs, which monitor the seismic waves that travel through the Earth after a quake.<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/07/middleeast/earthquake-turkey-syria-why-deadly-intl/index.html" target="_blank">Source</a>| Stresses in the earths outer layer push the sides of the fault together. Stress builds up and the rocks slip suddenly, releasing energy in waves that travel through the earths crust and cause the shaking that we feel during an earthquake." Earthquakes are measured using seismographs, which monitor the seismic waves that travel through the Earth after a quake. Many may recognize the term "Richter Scale" which scientists previously used for many years, but these days they generally follow the Modified Mercalli Intensity Scale (MMI), which is a more accurate measure of a quakes size, according to the USGS.|

The aftershocks stretch for more than 300 kilometers (186 miles) along the fault zone that ruptured in southern Turkey, oriented from southwest to northeast and stretching from the border with Syria up through the province of Malatya.|
