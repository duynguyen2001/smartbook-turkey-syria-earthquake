# Why is the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant a target for Russia?

## Summary
The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP), located on the eastern bank of the Dnipro river in Ukraine, is a target for Russia due to its strategic location and the potential for it to serve the Russian electricity market (1). The plant has been under Russian control since the beginning of the war, and the cost to replace it is estimated at $7 billion (2). It has come under fire repeatedly in recent months, with a large-caliber shell damaging a technical water pipe (3), and three main external 750 kV (kilovolt) power lines being lost (5). This means that the plant is dependent on its last operating reactor for vital electricity supplies, making it a precarious target (5).

|---|---|
|Each of Zaporizhzhia's reactors would cost $7 billion to replace, making the plant a target for Russians to capture undamaged, with hopes of serving its own electricity market, according to analysis by defense and security intelligence firm Janes.<a href="https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/russia-ukraine-war-news-09-17-22/h_7dc0b03ad7b5b6356439496a8a23b9c5" target="_blank">Source</a>| The Zaporizhzhia plant is located on the eastern bank of the Dnipro river in Ukraine. The area, and the nuclear complex, has been under Russian controlsince the beginning of the war, but the plant is still mostlyoperated by Ukrainian workers. Each of Zaporizhzhia's reactors would cost $7 billion to replace, making the plant a target for Russians to capture undamaged, with hopes of serving its own electricity market, according to analysis by defense and security intelligence firm Janes. Should Russia keep it, Ukraine would lose 20% of its domestic electricity generating capacity.|
|Reason: Russia hopes to use the plant to serve its own electricity market.<a href="https://www.theweek.in/news/world/2022/09/28/russian-referendum-fate-of-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-power-plant-uncertain.html" target="_blank">Source</a>| The plant, located on the eastern bank of the Dnipro river, has been under Russian control since the beginning of the war but is still being operated by Ukrainian workers. Though the plant has been witnessing intense shelling and explosion, experts don't think anything disastrous would happen, at least for now. Reason: Russia hopes to use the plant to serve its own electricity market. Analysts from defence and security intelligence firm Janes believe Russia would likely keep the plant, thereby depriving Ukraine of 20 per cent of its domestic electricity-generating capacity.|
|Fears that Russias war in Ukraine could cause a nuclear catastrophe had focused so far on the countrys largest atomic energy station, in Zaporizhzhia, where all six reactors have now been shut down.<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/09/19/ukraine-russia-war-nuclear-plant-pugacheva/" target="_blank">Source</a>| "We have to stop it before its too late." Russia did not immediately comment on the allegation. Fears that Russias war in Ukraine could cause a nuclear catastrophe had focused so far on the countrys largest atomic energy station, in Zaporizhzhia, where all six reactors have now been shut down. Repeated shelling and fires had disconnected the Zaporizhzhia plant from the national electricity grid, requiring emergency measures to prevent essential cooling procedures from being interrupted.|
|It remains close to the frontline, and has come under fire repeatedly in recent months, raising fears of a nuclear catastrophe.<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russia-says-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant-water-pipe-damaged-by-shell-2022-09-21/" target="_blank">Source</a>| MOSCOW, Sept 21 (Reuters) - Russia's defence ministry on Wednesday said that a large-caliber shell had damaged a technical water pipe at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in Ukraine, Russian state-owned news agency RIA reported. The Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant was captured by Russian forces in March. It remains close to the frontline, and has come under fire repeatedly in recent months, raising fears of a nuclear catastrophe. Both Ukraine and Russia blame each other for shelling the facility.|
|Russia and Ukraine have blamed each other for shelling at the site of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP) that has damaged buildings and caused the disconnection of power lines.<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/main-power-line-back-up-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-power-plant-iaea-says-2022-09-17/" target="_blank">Source</a>| "With the main line's reconnection yesterday afternoon, the three back-up power lines are again being held in reserve," the International Atomic Energy Agency watchdog said in a statement. "The three other main external 750 kV (kilovolt) power lines that were lost earlier during the conflict remain down," it added. Russia and Ukraine have blamed each other for shelling at the site of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP) that has damaged buildings and caused the disconnection of power lines. "While the ZNPP's power status has improved over the past week in sharp contrast to earlier this month when all power lines at one stage were down and it depended on its last operating reactor for vital electricity supplies the general situation for the plant located in the middle of a war zone remains precarious," the IAEA said.|
