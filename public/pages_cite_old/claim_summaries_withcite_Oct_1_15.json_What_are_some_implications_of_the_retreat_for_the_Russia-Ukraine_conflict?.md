# What are some implications of the retreat for the Russia-Ukraine conflict?

## Summary
The retreat of Russian forces from the town of Lyman in eastern Ukraine marks a significant setback for Russia, as it complicates their internationally vilified move to annex four regions of Ukraine and disrupts their supply lines along the eastern front (1). NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said this gain by Ukraine demonstrates the Ukrainians' progress in pushing back the Russian forces (5). The withdrawal has led to public criticism of Russia's military leadership by senior officials (3). Furthermore, the Russian forces likely experienced heavy casualties in their retreat from Lyman, which was their logistics hub in the Donetsk region (2).
