# What motivated the US government to get involved in the prisoner exchange between Russia and Ukraine?

## Summary
The US government got involved in the prisoner exchange between Russia and Ukraine due to its belief that it could help Ukrainian fighters (1). In the deal, nearly 300 people were swapped, including prisoners of war from countries including the United States, the United Kingdom, and Morocco (2). US Secretary of State Antony Blinken welcomed the exchange and thanked Saudi Arabia for spearheading the initiative (3). Despite some skepticism surrounding Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince's motivations, the Saudi foreign minister denied any attempt to improve its image in the West (4). The exchange also included the release of a Navy veteran who had been held by the Taliban-linked Haqqani network for 17 months (5).

|Drueke joined the Army at age 19 after the terror attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, and he believed he could help Ukrainian fighters because of his training and experience with weapons, Shaw said previously.<a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/09/21/1124405588/alex-drueke-andy-huynh-release-prisoner-exchange-russia" target="_blank">Source</a>| Russian state television had previously said Drueke and Huynh were being held by Russian-backed separatists in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine. The U.S. does not recognize the sovereignty of the Donetsk People's Republic and has no diplomatic relations with them, making it necessary for others to lead efforts to get the men released. Drueke joined the Army at age 19 after the terror attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, and he believed he could help Ukrainian fighters because of his training and experience with weapons, Shaw said previously.

|The exchange is one of the most significant prisoner swaps to take place under the Biden administration, coming five months after a separate deal with Russia that resulted in the release of Marine veteran Trevor Reed.<a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/09/19/1123786512/american-hostage-afghanistan-matt-frerichs-released" target="_blank">Source</a>| Mark Frerichs, a Navy veteran who had spent more than a decade in Afghanistan as a civilian contractor, was abducted in January 2020 and is believed to have been held since then by the Taliban-linked Haqqani network. He was traded for Bashir Noorzai, a Taliban associate convicted of heroin trafficking in 2008 who had spent 17 years behind bars before his release Monday. The exchange is one of the most significant prisoner swaps to take place under the Biden administration, coming five months after a separate deal with Russia that resulted in the release of Marine veteran Trevor Reed. Frerichs' family and other advocates had feared that the U.S. military departure from Afghanistan, and the rise of the Taliban to power, would make it harder to bring him home and would deflect attention away from his imprisonment.|
