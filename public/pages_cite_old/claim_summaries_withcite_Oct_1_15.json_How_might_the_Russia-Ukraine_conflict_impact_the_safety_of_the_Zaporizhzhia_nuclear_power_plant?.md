# How might the Russia-Ukraine conflict impact the safety of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant?

## Summary
The Russian-Ukraine conflict has raised serious concerns about the safety of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP). The plant has been under Russian control since early March, yet is still operated by its Ukrainian staff (1). It has been repeatedly shelled, leading to the shutdown of all six reactors (2). The IAEA's Director General, Rafael Mariano Grossi, has asked for a safety and security zone to be established around the plant (3). In addition, analysts have highlighted the increased danger of the conflict at the plant (4). The IAEA has sent a team to the plant and Grossi has held talks in Kyiv and will soon travel to Russia (5). Therefore, it is clear that the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine has greatly impacted the safety of the ZNPP.

|---|---|
|It has been damaged by shelling during the conflict and all six reactors have been shut down.<a href="https://www.world-nuclear-news.org/Articles/Ukraine-Russia-and-control-of-Zaporizhzhia-nuclear" target="_blank">Source</a>| It has been under the control of the Russian military since early March but has continued to be operated by its Ukrainian staff. It is near the frontline of the war in territory which President Putin has said has been annexed by Russia. It has been damaged by shelling during the conflict and all six reactors have been shut down. International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi has been leading efforts to establish a safety and security zone at, and around, the plant.|
|Efforts to prevent a radiation disaster have also been stymied by the fact that the city has repeatedly been a target of Russian blasts.<a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/10/09/1127750930/ukraine-russia-nuclear-plant-restored-temporary" target="_blank">Source</a>| It's been captured and occupied by Russian forces since March, though some Ukrainian workers still operate the plant. The city is the capital of the Zaporizhzhia region, one of four Ukrainian territories that Russian President Vladimir Putin illegally annexed last month. Efforts to prevent a radiation disaster have also been stymied by the fact that the city has repeatedly been a target of Russian blasts. That has left not only the plant vulnerable, but also local residents who rely on it for electricity.|
|Its capture, and the ongoing fighting at the site, have set off global alarms over the possibility of catastrophic damage and deadly plumes of radioactive fallout.<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/09/science/ukraine-nuclear-power-plant-crisis.html" target="_blank">Source</a>| Analysts divide the 42-year history into intensifying stages. The dangers soared in March when Russian troops attacked the six reactors at the Zaporizhzhia power plant in Ukraine and seized control of the giant complex. Its capture, and the ongoing fighting at the site, have set off global alarms over the possibility of catastrophic damage and deadly plumes of radioactive fallout. Russias siege of the Zaporizhzhia site is without precedent in the history of warfare, with an invading power aiming to extract economic leverage over a highly complex power generation plant.|
|The situation at the plant is a source of international concern because of fears that repeated shelling of the plant's territory - for which Kyiv and Moscow blame each other - could lead to a nuclear accident.<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/iaea-chief-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-power-plant-is-ukrainian-facility-2022-10-06/" target="_blank">Source</a>| Russia has occupied the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP), Europe's largest, since shortly after its invasion of Ukraine, but Ukrainian staff have continued to operate it. The ZNPP is located in a part of southern Ukraine that Putin has formally incorporated into Russia after holding what Moscow called referendums, in a move condemned by Kyiv and its Western partners as an illegal land grab. The situation at the plant is a source of international concern because of fears that repeated shelling of the plant's territory - for which Kyiv and Moscow blame each other - could lead to a nuclear accident.

|The head of the UNs nuclear watchdog, Rafael Grossi, was in Kyiv on Thursday to discuss his calls to establish a nuclear safety zone around the plant "as soon as possible," the IAEA said in a statement.<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/06/europe/russia-ukraine-zaporizhzhia-city-plant-intl/index.html" target="_blank">Source</a>| The Zaporizhzhia plant has been subject to intense scrutiny since its occupation shortly after Russias invasion in late February. Intense shelling near the facility this summer sparked concerns of a nuclear accident, prompting the International Atomic Energy Agency to send a team there. The head of the UNs nuclear watchdog, Rafael Grossi, was in Kyiv on Thursday to discuss his calls to establish a nuclear safety zone around the plant "as soon as possible," the IAEA said in a statement. Grossi will also visit Russia in the coming days.|
