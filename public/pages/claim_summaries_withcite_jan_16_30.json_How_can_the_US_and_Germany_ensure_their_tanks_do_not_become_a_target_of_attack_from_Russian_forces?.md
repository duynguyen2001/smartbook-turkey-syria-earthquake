# How can the US and Germany ensure their tanks do not become a target of attack from Russian forces?

## Summary
The US and Germany have been locked in a standoff over whether to send tanks to Ukraine to help the country's troops push back Russian forces. The US has been wary of deploying its M1 Abrams tanks due to the logistical costs of maintaining them, while Germany has been unwilling to send its Leopard 2 tanks unless the US also commits tanks. However, a preliminary agreement has recently been struck for the US to send 31 M1 Abrams tanks in order to convince Germany to pledge its easier-to-operate Leopards. In addition, other allied European states will also send tanks to equip two battalions <font color=#FF3399>[1]</font>. To ensure their tanks do not become a target of attack from Russian forces, Ukraine has requested long-range missiles and aircraft from NATO <font color=#FF3399>[4]</font> in order to provide protection and conserve artillery <font color=#FF3399>[5]</font>.
