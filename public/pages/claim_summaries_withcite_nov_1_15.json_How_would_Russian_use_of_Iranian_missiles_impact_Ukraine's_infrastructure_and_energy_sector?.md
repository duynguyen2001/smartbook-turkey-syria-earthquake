By shifting demand for natural gas, the U.S. and EU hope to both accelerate the clean energy transition and curtail Russian energy revenues, "which are used to fund the unprovoked and unjustified war," according to the statement. With winter approaching, Ukraine is also bracing for increased challenges in civilian energy as damage to infrastructure has caused widespread outages and the need for scheduled blackouts to stabilize power systems. The U.S. and EU have provided and will continue to provide emergency energy assistance to Ukraine and surrounding regions heavily impacted by Russia's attacks on energy, per the statement.|
