# What steps can be taken to ensure the safety of civilians in the city of Melitopol?

## Summary
The city of Melitopol has been under Russian occupation since the early days of the invasion, resulting in restrictions on civilians, such as the prohibition of approaching the airfield <font color=#FF3399>[1]</font> and children not being allowed outside during breaks between lessons <font color=#FF3399>[2]</font>. The dire situation facing Melitopolâ€™s civilians is exacerbated by unemployment, shortages of medicines and high prices for medications <font color=#FF3399>[2]</font>. Moreover, there is a worrying trend of children being taken from occupied areas to Crimea and parts of Russia <font color=#FF3399>[4]</font>. As such, for the safety of civilians in the city, there needs to be reparations for all war crimes committed <font color=#FF3399>[3]</font>, punishment for each war criminal <font color=#FF3399>[3]</font> and guarantees that such an invasion and atrocities will not happen again <font color=#FF3399>[3]</font>. Furthermore, the threat of bombardment from long-range missiles near Crimea must be addressed <font color=#FF3399>[5]</font>.
