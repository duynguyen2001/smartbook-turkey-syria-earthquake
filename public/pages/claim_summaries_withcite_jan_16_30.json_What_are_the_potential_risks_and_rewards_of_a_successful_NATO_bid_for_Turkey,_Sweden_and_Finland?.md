# What are the potential risks and rewards of a successful NATO bid for Turkey, Sweden and Finland?

## Summary
The potential risks and rewards of a successful NATO bid for Turkey, Sweden and Finland are high. Turkey has the power to block either country's entry as it is already a member <font color=#FF3399>[1]</font>, and has made certain demands of Sweden in order to approve their application <font color=#FF3399>[5]</font>. However, the two Nordic countries remain optimistic that they can obtain Hungary's approval in February or March <font color=#FF3399>[3]</font>. Sweden and Finland have reversed their long-held policy of nonalignment in light of Russia's aggression, and have taken steps to move forward in tandem <font color=#FF3399>[1]</font>. If successful, the two countries would benefit from the collective security of NATO, while Erdogan may use the issue of NATO accession as a political tool to gain votes in the upcoming elections <font color=#FF3399>[4]</font>.
