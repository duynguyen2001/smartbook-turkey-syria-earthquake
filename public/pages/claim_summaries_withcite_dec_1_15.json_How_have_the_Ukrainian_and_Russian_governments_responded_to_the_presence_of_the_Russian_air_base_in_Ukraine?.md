The Engels base, near the city of Saratov, is at least 600 km (372 miles) from the nearest Ukrainian territory. Russia responded to Mondays attacks with what it called a "massive strike on Ukraines military control system", though it did not identify any specific military targets for what Ukraine called Moscows latest strikes on civilian infrastructure. Missiles across Ukraine destroyed homes and knocked out power, but the impact seemed less severe than barrages last month that pitched millions of Ukrainians into darkness and cold.|

Each time Ukrainian forces deliver a long-range high-precision attack from the sinking of the Moskva cruiser in mid-April 2022 to the strike on Saky air base in Crimea in early August and the swarm attack of air and naval drones on Sevastopol in late October Russia has been caught unprepared and has struggled to find a response. In retaliation for the December 5 strikes, Russia sought to hit back with yet another missile strike on Ukrainian energy infrastructure, but the strength of this operation was slightly below the six previous missile attacks from October 10, and this was certainly no surprise for Ukraines missile defense (Nezavisimoe voennoe obozrenie, December 8).|
