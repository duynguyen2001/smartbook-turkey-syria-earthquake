# What are the potential consequences of Belarus becoming a vassal state of Russia?

## Summary
The potential consequences of Belarus becoming a vassal state of Russia are becoming increasingly clear. After a rigged election in 2020, Russian President Vladimir Putin has been providing Belarus with economic support, including a $1.5 billion lifeline and preferential deals for oil and gas, as well as military backing in the form of joint exercises with Belarusian troops and the deployment of Russian soldiers <font color=#FF3399>[1,2]</font>. In return, Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko has agreed to coordinate efforts with Moscow in the face of Western sanctions and has maintained that the Russian-Belarusian relationship is in a record-breaking state <font color=#FF3399>[3,4]</font>. However, some, such as Yevgeniy Prigozhin, have been advocating for further escalation, which creates a risk for Putin in 2023 leading up to the 2024 presidential elections <font color=#FF3399>[5]</font>.
