|Its capture, and the ongoing fighting at the site, have set off global alarms over the possibility of catastrophic damage and deadly plumes of radioactive fallout.<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/09/science/ukraine-nuclear-power-plant-crisis.html" target="_blank">Source</a>| Analysts divide the 42-year history into intensifying stages. The dangers soared in March when Russian troops attacked the six reactors at the Zaporizhzhia power plant in Ukraine and seized control of the giant complex. Its capture, and the ongoing fighting at the site, have set off global alarms over the possibility of catastrophic damage and deadly plumes of radioactive fallout. Russias siege of the Zaporizhzhia site is without precedent in the history of warfare, with an invading power aiming to extract economic leverage over a highly complex power generation plant.|

Putin also instructed the cabinet to determine how to regulate and operate the Zaporizhzhia plant which has been under Russian military control since March through 2028.|
|Efforts to prevent a radiation disaster have also been stymied by the fact that the city has repeatedly been a target of Russian blasts.<a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/10/09/1127750930/ukraine-russia-nuclear-plant-restored-temporary" target="_blank">Source</a>| It's been captured and occupied by Russian forces since March, though some Ukrainian workers still operate the plant. The city is the capital of the Zaporizhzhia region, one of four Ukrainian territories that Russian President Vladimir Putin illegally annexed last month. Efforts to prevent a radiation disaster have also been stymied by the fact that the city has repeatedly been a target of Russian blasts. That has left not only the plant vulnerable, but also local residents who rely on it for electricity.|
