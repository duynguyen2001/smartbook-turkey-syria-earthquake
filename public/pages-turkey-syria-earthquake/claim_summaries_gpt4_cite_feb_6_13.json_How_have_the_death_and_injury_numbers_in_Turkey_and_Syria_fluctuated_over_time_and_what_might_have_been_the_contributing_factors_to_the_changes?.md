# How have the death and injury numbers in Turkey and Syria fluctuated over time and what might have been the contributing factors to the changes?

## Summary
The death and injury numbers in Turkey and Syria from the devastating earthquakes have fluctuated over time. The earliest reported death toll was at least 19,738 with Turkey accounting for at least 16,546 of those deaths and 66,132 injuries (Context 1). However, these numbers increased over time, with the death toll rising to at least 20,783, and Turkey's deaths and injuries increasing to at least 17,406 and 70,347 respectively (Context 2). Despite this, there was a slight decrease in the total death toll to at least 19,863, but the numbers in Turkey remained the same (Context 3). The death toll then increased again to 20,451 with Turkey seeing a rise to 17,134 deaths and maintaining the same number of injuries (Context 4). The lowest reported death toll came in at 17,543 with Turkey accounting for at least 14,351 of those deaths and 63,794 injuries (Context 5). The fluctuations in these numbers could be due to various factors such as the intensity of the earthquakes, the effectiveness of rescue efforts, or the accuracy of initial reports.
