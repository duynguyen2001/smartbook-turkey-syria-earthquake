# How do the aftershocks, particularly those measuring 6.0 or greater, compound the damage caused by the original earthquake in Turkey?

## Summary
A 7.8 magnitude earthquake caused significant damage in southern Turkey, with its aftershocks further compounding the devastation <font color=#FF3399>[3]</font>. According to the United States Geological Survey, over 100 aftershocks measuring 4.0 or more have been recorded since the original quake, with aftershocks likely to continue, posing additional threats to already compromised structures <font color=#FF3399>[3]</font>. Particularly, aftershocks measuring 6.0 or greater, such as the 7.5 magnitude one reported 95 kilometers north of the main quake's epicenter, have the potential to cause severe damage <font color=#FF3399>[4]</font>. These aftershocks span over 300 kilometers along the fault zone from southwest to northeast, increasing the risk of further destruction <font color=#FF3399>[3, 4]</font>. This constant threat from aftershocks not only hampers rescue efforts but also forces the survivors to choose between returning to unstable homes or seeking shelter elsewhere amidst freezing temperatures <font color=#FF3399>[1]</font>.

|<font color=#FF3399>[1]</font> Severe cold weather has only made matters worse with temperatures dropping below freezing at night, increasing the risk of hypothermia, and hampering relief efforts.<a href="https://reliefweb.int/report/turkiye/massive-earthquake-has-hit-turkiye-turkey-and-syria-killing-over-five-thousand-people-injuring-many-thousands-more-and-devastating-entire-communities" target="_blank">Source</a>| Over 2,000 homes have been destroyed in Trkiye (Turkey) and the scale of the devastation in Syria is yet to emerge. In addition, significant aftershocks continue to be felt across both countries meaning people have to face the agonizing choice of returning to homes that may collapse in an aftershock or seeking shelter elsewhere. Severe cold weather has only made matters worse with temperatures dropping below freezing at night, increasing the risk of hypothermia, and hampering relief efforts. How Were Responding|
